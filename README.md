Project Title: End-to-End Automobile Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Description:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the price of automobiles based on various input features such as make, model, mileage, year of manufacture, engine size, and other relevant attributes. The project will follow a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline, encompassing data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment.
